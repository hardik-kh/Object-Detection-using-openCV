Working Screenshot
-------
| Car recognization        | Keyboard recognization          | 
| ------------- | ---------|
| <img src ="car.jpg" height = "300" width = "450">     | <img src ="keyboard.jpg" height = "300" width = "450">|
| Bird recognization        | Chair recognization          |
| ------------- | ---------|
| <img src ="bird.bmp" height = "300" width = "450">     | <img src ="chair.jpg" height = "300" width = "450">|



### Recognition takes place above 50% confidence level
